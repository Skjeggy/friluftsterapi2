abstract: This paper addresses pluralistic understandings of wilderness in the
  context of wilderness therapy (WT). The term wilderness perpetuates a modern
  worldview of place that beyond ‘civilisation’ exists an environment defined by
  risk, fear and an unpredictable nature. WT utilises outdoor travel and living
  practices during therapeutic intervention and health promotion although
  empirical justification for its use of wilderness for therapy is not yet
  established. This paper provides three cultural perspectives on wild places in
  relation to WT. These national perspectives are informed by local practices,
  historical and societal understandings of wilderness and supported by related
  literature from Canada, Norway and Australia. The authors (1) illustrate a
  number of contemporary western assumptions about wilderness enshrined in the
  WT and outdoor adventure literature, (2) cautiously propose core purposes for
  using wild places for therapy and (3) encourage further development of WT
  practice and research within national, regional and even across organisational
  contexts.
