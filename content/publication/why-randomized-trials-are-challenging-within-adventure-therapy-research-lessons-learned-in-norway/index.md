abstract: There are few high-quality studies using randomized controlled trials
  (RCTs) in the adventure and wilderness therapy literature. Thus, a unison call
  is heard for more such studies to be carried out. This article presents a
  Norwegian wilderness therapy research project that planned to incorporate this
  “gold standard” that is regarded as the most scientific and rigorous approach
  available. We did not succeed. Mounting challenges led us to discard the RCT
  altogether and select other methodologies. Here, we account for the ethical,
  health outcome, practical, and empirical obstacles that we encountered when
  attempting to randomize at-risk adolescents into experiment and control
  groups. Our conclusion is that although RCTs may be superior in some aspects,
  they hold the potential to become bad science when the interventions are as
  complex and multi-faceted as adventure and wilderness therapy programs.
