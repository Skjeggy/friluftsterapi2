abstract: Despite the rich traditions of outdoor life in the Scandinavian
  countries, structured nature-based therapeutic interventions remain
  underexplored in adolescent mental health services. We suggest that wilderness
  therapy is an age-appropriate and effective group treatment that may hold
  particular appeal for at-risk youth who are less responsive to conventional
  forms of treatment. Although more widespread in other parts of the world,
  wilderness therapy may also be a viable treatment modality for the
  Scandinavian region. Our overall aim of this state-of-knowledge article is to
  provide an overview of wilderness therapy with regard to conceptualization,
  practice and research, and to discuss current challenges. Based on the
  available knowledge, we suggest that the addition of this nature-based group
  treatment could increase the diversity of treatment options in adolescent
  mental health services in Scandinavia and recommend rigorous intervention
  studies exploring what works, for whom, and in what circumstances.
