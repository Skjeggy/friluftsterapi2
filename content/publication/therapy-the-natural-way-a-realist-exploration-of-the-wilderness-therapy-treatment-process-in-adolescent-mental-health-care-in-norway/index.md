abstract: Wilderness therapy has the potential to meet the specific needs of the
  current adolescent population by providing a rather unique outdoor group
  treatment. Wilderness therapy is not a new approach to mental health
  treatment, but its theoretical basis is not yet clearly delineated, in part
  because of the diversity found across programs and contexts. This article
  presents a critical realist exploration of a wilderness therapy program that
  was recently implemented as part of adolescent mental health services in
  Southern Norway. In this study, we combine fieldwork and interviews for an
  in-depth investigation of the treatment process, where the objective was to
  acquire a deeper understanding of the opportunities that arise in the
  wilderness therapy setting. The therapeutic mechanisms and influential
  contextual premises found across the ecological, physical, and psychosocial
  factors of this multidimensional approach to treatment are presented, and
  their underlying conditions are briefly discussed.
