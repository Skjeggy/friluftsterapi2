  Mental health suffering affects the daily life functioning of a large number
  of children and adolescents in Norway. Traditional treatment approaches, while
  experienced as helpful for many, may inhibit some adolescents. An apparent
  increase in referrals to specialist mental health treatment due to social
  isolation and anxiety initiated a local request for more variety of group
  treatments for adolescents. There was also a call to integrate the use of
  nature in mental health services throughout the Nordic region at the time of
  the onset of this clinical study. According to a socio-ecological approach to
  health, humans have an innate affiliation to nature and all living things. In
  the context of this study, health and well-being is understood as a state of
  balance, which is proposed to be contingent on a relation to self, others, and
  the more-than-human nature. The outdoor environment is suggested to be a
  rather unique context for mental health work as it is believed to potentially
  facilitate health-inducing and therapeutic processes in itself. In this thesis
  I present a qualitative study that explores the experiences and outcomes of
  participation in a newly implemented wilderness therapy group treatment in the
  adolescent mental health services in Southern Norway. This article-based
  thesis is made up of a total of four substudies, where each substudy resulted
  in a scientific article, of which three have been published and the fourth
  have been submitted. 


  The first substudy is a general state-of-knowledge review that explores the diverse field of wilderness therapy practice and research internationally. Wilderness therapy is suggested to be an age-appropriate and engaging group treatment for adolescents that might also appeal to individuals who have not found conventional treatment approaches to be helpful. Considering the rich tradition of outdoor life in Scandinavia, it may also be a culturally appropriate treatment option for health care services in this particular region. Potential challenges identified in the literature were considered in terms of their relevance for a Scandinavian context. This first paper is published in Scandinavian Psychologist.


  The second substudy is an in-depth realist review that unpacks the wilderness therapy treatment process, previously referred to as a black box in the literature. The synthesis of primary qualitative studies amounted to a number of explanatory configurations that described the influential contextual factors and therapeutic mechanisms in relation to reported outcomes found across the included studies. A theoretical framework was applied, tested, and furthermore extended into a proposed Wilderness Therapy Clinical Model, which was made up of three main therapeutic factors: the wilderness, the physical self, and the psychosocial self. This second paper is published in Qualitative Health Research.


  The third substudy is a realist exploration of the therapeutic process in the newly implemented wilderness therapy program, called Friluftsterapi, which translates as ‘therapy in the open air’. Through fieldwork and individual interviews that included two clinical groups, we inquired into the influential contextual factors and therapeutic opportunities–or mechanisms–that appeared to arise throughout the intervention. Nature-related mechanisms included a catalyst effect from venturing outdoors; transitions from chaos to calm in nature; along with a notion of disconnect to reconnect occurring on various levels. There were also therapeutic processes that seemed to emerge in the interplay of body and mind-or bodymind-referring to the single integrated unit, and emotional emancipation appeared to follow physical feats. The participants reported experiencing a synergy arising in the heterogeneous groups, although the dynamics of vulnerability and support were intricate. Finally, friluftsterapi was generally perceived to be an intriguing treatment, which made sense and had positive connotations to it, referred to as therapy the natural way. Limiting and enabling circumstances were explored, and underlying conditions of friluftsterapi were suggested to be its voluntary, resource-focused, and multidimensional basis. This third paper is published in Qualitative Health Research.


  The fourth substudy is a realist investigation of the perceived longitudinal outcomes from participation in the friluftsterapi program, explored through follow-up individual interviews that were conducted approximately a year after the treatment ended. A number of the participants reported having managed to transfer and also adapt strategies that they acquired in friluftsterapi, into their daily life environments. Whilst many were still struggling in various ways, the participants overall reported feeling less constrained by symptoms. This again seemed to enable a number of the adolescents to be more independent, return to school, and increase levels of activity and socialization. More fundamental processes appeared to include bodymind insights, self-acceptance, and (re)establishing agency, which were suggested to be conditioned by an underlying (re)connection with self. The fourth article is submitted to Journal of Adventure Education and Outdoor Learning. In the synthesis of the findings, friluftsterapi is proposed to have the potential to facilitate what seems to be a stratified, synergetic (re)connection with self, others, and nature. This multi-leveled connection is furthermore suggested to support participants to sustain or regain a sense of balance in terms of their health, well-being, and daily life functioning. Furthermore, an ontology of connectedness is introduced, which is supported by an optic of interconnectedness and an integrative self-understanding. 


  Finally, the three therapeutic factors of the wilderness therapy clinical model are revisited in the overall discussion. First, wilderness–or nature–may be our equilibrator. Second, in relation to the physical self, the embodied nature of our being and becoming is addressed. Third, arriving at the psychosocial self, our relational contingency is considered. Limitations include the influence of the researcher and the potential fallibility and incompleteness of the hypotheses and theories put forth. The study was limited to include two clinical groups from one Norwegian wilderness therapy program. Findings are likely to be highly context-dependent and not necessarily transferable beyond the included sample. Implications include the proposal of theoretical conceptualization based on empirical explorations into wilderness therapy the friluftsliv way, while utilizing the adolescent perspective as the vantage point. The present study took place in an early stage of a clinical research project and the tentative propositions and findings should be subjected to further empirical testing and refinement. Friluftsterapi is not suggested to be a panacea and will hardly be the treatment of choice for every adolescent (or therapist for that matter); however it appears to offer a holistic ecobiopsychosocial approach to mental health treatment. Considering the complex needs of the present iGeneration it might be a timely, age-appropriate, and intriguing treatment option as it appears to facilitate a connectedness unplugged with self, others, and the ‘wild’ as adolescent mental health care ventures into nature.
