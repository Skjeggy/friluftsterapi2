abstract: This paper is a twelve-month follow-up study that explores perceived
  outcomes from participation in a Norwegian wilderness therapy program. Through
  a critical realist approach, the authors performed an in-depth analysis of
  individual interviews with ten adolescent participants. Long-term outcomes
  included the transfer and adaptation of calming and nature-supported
  strategies to the participants’ home environments, improvements in mood and
  emotional regulation, and increased social interaction. Overall, the
  adolescents seemed to exert greater independence and agency in their lives at
  twelve months post-treatment. This ability appeared to be facilitated by
  underlying processes that entailed insight, awareness, and acceptance of
  oneself and one’s situation. The authors suggest that these emerging stories
  are fragile, yet conditioned by a fundamental (re)connection with the self and
  address this cautious proposition in the discussion. Finally, a more precise
  theoretical framework should be developed to support future in-depth
  explorations.
