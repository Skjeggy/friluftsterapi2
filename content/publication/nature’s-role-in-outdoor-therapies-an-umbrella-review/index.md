abstract: "Objective: To report on the role of nature in outdoor therapies
  through review and summary of existing systematic and meta-analytic reviews in
  an effort to articulate a theoretical framework for practice. Materials and
  methods: An umbrella review was conducted following systematic protocols
  PRISMA guidelines. Results: Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria and
  represented five self-identified approaches: nature-based therapies, forest
  therapy, horticultural therapy, wilderness therapy, and adventure therapy.
  Clear and comprehensive descriptions of theory, program structure, and
  activity details with causal links to outcomes were mostly absent.
  Conclusions: A rigorous and determined program of research is required in
  order to explicit in-depth theories of change in outdoor therapies.
  Conversely, or maybe concurrently, a holistic theory of integrated relatedness
  may be developed as a parallel expression of support for nature in therapy
  while the explanatory science catches up."
