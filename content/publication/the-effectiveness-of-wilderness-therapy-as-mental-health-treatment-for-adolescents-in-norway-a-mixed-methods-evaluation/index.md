abstract: This paper investigates the effectiveness of a Norwegian wilderness
  therapy programme, Friluftsterapi, which is offered to adolescents within a
  specialized mental health care setting. This mixed methods study incorporated
  (1) psychometric pre-, post-, and 12 month follow-up data, (2) executive
  functioning data, and (3) qualitative data from two rounds of individual
  participant interviews. The results indicate that group averages remained
  largely the same between the pre- and post-tests, however that health measures
  generally improved one year later (Cohen’s d effect sizes ± 0.5). Interview
  data revealed that the processing of the Friluftsterapi experiences takes time
  and that for many several months are required before the impact is fully
  internalized and translated into improved daily functioning. In conclusion,
  the Friluftsterapi experience is perceived as valuable, and it appears to
  contribute towards improving the mental health of many participants. A refined
  version of the treatment programme is suggested and briefly presented in the
  conclusion.
